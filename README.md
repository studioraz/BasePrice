## How to use
Every product needs detailed information about the base price calculation. There are four attributes which every product has:
* Product amount: Select the amount the product gets selled with quantity 1
* Product unit: Select the unit the product gets selled with
* Reference amount: Select the reference amount the product price has to be calculated with
* Reference unit: Select the reference unit the product price has to be calculated with

**Example**: You have a product which is a bottle of milk which is 100 ml of size. It costs 2 €.   
You want to display the price of milk for 1 l which is 20 €.   
Therefore you have to configure your product like the following:
* Product amount: 100
* Product unit: ml
* Reference amount: 1
* Reference unit: l

You can configure the attributes in a product edit mask under the tab Base Price on the left side.
